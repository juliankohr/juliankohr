### Hi, I'm Julian ‚úåüèΩ

### A designer and technologist passionate about the intersection between humans and technology, designing experiences for both, the digital and physical world.

I am currently working at KUKA in Augsburg on future possibilities for human-robot collaboration and programming, with the aim of widen accessibility to people with little prior knowledge.
On the side, I tinker with smart home integrations, AR/VR apps and machine learning models.
