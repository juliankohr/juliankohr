### Hi, my name is Julian ‚úåüèΩ

### A designer and technologist passionate about the intersection between humans and robotics, designing experiences for both, the digital and physical world.

Currently I am working on future ways of human robot collaboration within the Automation Software Factory at KUKA in Augsburg.
On the side, I tinker with context-specific interactions of ubiquitous systems and test different concepts through prototypes.
